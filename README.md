### Technical Enhancements
```python

def add_technical_indicators(data):
    df = data.copy()
    
    # Moving averages
    df['MA_7'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=7).mean()
    df['MA_21'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=21).mean()
    df['MA_50'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
    
    # RSI calculation
    delta = df['Close'].diff()
    gain = (delta.where(delta > 0, 0)).rolling(window=14).mean()
    loss = (-delta.where(delta < 0, 0)).rolling(window=14).mean()
    rs = gain / loss
    df['RSI'] = 100 - (100 / (1 + rs))
    
    # ... more indicators
    return df
```

from improved_stock_prediction import StockPredictor

# Initialize predictor
predictor = StockPredictor(lookback_window=60, test_size=0.2)

# Fetch data
stock_data = predictor.fetch_stock_data(['AAPL', 'GOOGL'], years=3)

# Prepare data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, scaler = predictor.prepare_data('AAPL')

# Build and train model
model = predictor.build_model(lstm_units=[64, 32, 16])
history = predictor.train_model(epochs=50)

# Evaluate
metrics = predictor.evaluate_model()
predictor.plot_results(metrics, symbol='AAPL')
```

### Advanced Configuration
```python
# Custom model configuration
predictor = StockPredictor(
    lookback_window=90,    # 90 days of history
    test_size=0.15         # 15% for testing
)

# Custom LSTM architecture
model = predictor.build_model(
    lstm_units=[128, 64, 32],    # Larger model
    dropout_rate=0.3,            # Higher dropout
    learning_rate=0.0005         # Lower learning rate
)

# Extended training
history = predictor.train_model(
    epochs=100,
    batch_size=16,
    patience=15

```

## 📊 Visualization Examples

The improved version provides comprehensive visualizations:

1. **Stock Price with Technical Indicators**
2. **LSTM Training History**
3. **Prediction vs Actual Comparison**
4. **Residual Analysis**
5. **Performance Metrics Dashboard**

## ⚠ Important Notes

### Original Code Issues
The original `STOCK_PREDICTION_LSTM_.ipynb` had these critical problems:
- NameError: 'company_name' not defined
- NameError: 'model' not defined  
- Missing LSTM model implementation
- Incomplete data preprocessing
- No proper train/test split
- Missing evaluation metrics

### Performance Considerations
- **GPU Recommended**: Training time significantly improved with GPU
- **Memory Usage**: Requires 4-8GB RAM for large datasets
- **Data Quality**: Model performance depends on data quality
- **Market Conditions**: Performance varies with market volatility

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **TensorFlow Installation**: Use `pip install tensorflow==2.13.0` for stability
2. **yfinance Errors**: Check internet connection and symbol validity
3. **Memory Errors**: Reduce lookback_window or batch_size
4. **Poor Performance**: Increase training epochs or add more features

### Performance Tips
- Use GPU for faster training
- Experiment with different lookback windows (30-120 days)
- Try different LSTM architectures
- Add more technical indicators for better prediction
